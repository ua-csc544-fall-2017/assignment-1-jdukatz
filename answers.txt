1. I'm taking this course because I think it will help me present data to future employers,
which will be useful especially when they have little/no NLP knowledge.

2. Basic javascript, how to format good visualizations

3. Python, Java, Scala

4. Python

5. Nope.

6. The reddit dataset I used for my data science final project last semester. I used bigquery
to pull the data, and python to manipulate/analyze it. I actually think my final report would
have been greatly improved by some nice visualizations.

7. /r/dataisbeautiful has some really cool ones. This maybe isn't my favorite of all time, but it
sticks out because it's NLP related:

In their source code they also have a markov pseudo-word generator based on these frequencies.

8. There are some really terrible ones that also get upvoted there. This does look interesting visually,
but it also makes it look like 900 planes take off from ATL every day at 10:00am.

9. Definitely not the same level as someone who was a CS major, but I don't feel like I've had that much
trouble coding-wise in my classes so far, so maybe 60th percentile?

10. My undergrad major was in math, so hopefully a bit higher than average, although it's been a
long time since I've done much pure math related stuff. 75th percentile?

11. Used it a lot at my internship this summer (github). Used an inhouse-built system at my previous job.

12. Used it for everything this past summer. Not a master by any means, but familiar with branching, merging, etc.

13. All the company's code was hosted on github.

14. I just heard that it takes about three years for the amount of rain which has fallen on Houston so far to fall on
Tucson. Yikes!
